## Security Best Practices

<Steps>
  ### Enable MFA
  Require multi-factor authentication for all accounts
  
  ### Regular Audits
  Conduct periodic security audits and assessments
  
  ### Access Control
  Implement proper role-based access control (RBAC)
  
  ### Monitor Activity
  Set up comprehensive security monitoring and alerts
</Steps>
