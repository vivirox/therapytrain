## Prerequisites

Before starting a deployment, ensure you have:

1. AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
2. Terraform CLI installed (version >= 1.0.0)
3. Access to the AWS Console (if needed for monitoring)
4. Required environment variables set:
   ```bash
   export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile
   export TF_VAR_environment=production
   export TF_VAR_app_name=your-app
   ```

## Initial Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Verify the infrastructure plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Apply the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Prepare for Deployment

1. Tag your release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. Update the task definition:
   ```bash
   aws ecs register-task-definition --cli-input-json file://task-definition.json
   ```

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment

1. Create a new deployment:
   ```bash
   aws deploy create-deployment \
     --application-name your-app \
     --deployment-group-name your-deployment-group \
     --revision revisionLocation
   ```

2. Monitor deployment progress:
   ```bash
   aws deploy get-deployment \
     --deployment-id deployment-id
   ```

### 3. Traffic Shifting

The deployment process automatically:
1. Creates a new (green) environment
2. Routes 10% of traffic to green environment
3. Monitors for errors and performance
4. If successful, shifts 100% traffic to green
5. Terminates old (blue) environment

## Canary Releases

### 1. Initiate Canary

1. Start with 10% traffic:
   ```bash
   aws elbv2 modify-listener \
     --listener-arn $LISTENER_ARN \
     --default-actions file://canary-actions.json
   ```

2. Monitor canary metrics:
   - Error rates
   - Latency
   - Resource utilization

### 2. Validation

The canary analysis Lambda function automatically:
1. Collects metrics for 10 minutes
2. Compares against thresholds
3. Makes promotion/rollback decision

## Rollback Procedures

### 1. Automatic Rollback

Automatic rollback is triggered when:
- Error rate exceeds 1%
- P95 latency exceeds 1000ms
- Health check failures occur

### 2. Manual Rollback

To manually rollback:

1. Stop the deployment:
   ```bash
   aws deploy stop-deployment \
     --deployment-id deployment-id
   ```

2. Revert to previous version:
   ```bash
   aws deploy create-deployment \
     --application-name your-app \
     --deployment-group-name your-deployment-group \
     --revision previousRevisionLocation
   ```

## Monitoring During Deployment

### 1. CloudWatch Dashboards

Access the deployment dashboard:
1. Open AWS Console
2. Navigate to CloudWatch
3. Open "your-app-deployment" dashboard

### 2. Key Metrics

Monitor these metrics during deployment:
- HTTP 5xx errors
- Response latency
- CPU/Memory utilization
- Request count

### 3. Logs

View deployment logs:
1. Open CloudWatch Logs
2. Check log groups:
   - /aws/codedeploy/your-app
   - /aws/ecs/your-app

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. Health Check Failures
   - Verify application health endpoint
   - Check security group rules
   - Review application logs

2. Canary Analysis Failures
   - Check CloudWatch metrics
   - Review Lambda function logs
   - Verify threshold configurations

3. Traffic Shifting Issues
   - Verify listener rules
   - Check target group health
   - Review ALB access logs

### Debug Steps

1. Check deployment status:
   ```bash
   aws deploy get-deployment \
     --deployment-id deployment-id
   ```

2. Review deployment events:
   ```bash
   aws deploy list-deployment-events \
     --deployment-id deployment-id
   ```

3. Check ECS service events:
   ```bash
   aws ecs describe-services \
     --cluster your-cluster \
     --services your-service
   ```

### Support

For additional support:
1. Check deployment logs
2. Review CloudWatch metrics
3. Contact DevOps team
4. Escalate to AWS support if needed
