# [ADR-0001] Core Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Gradiant needs a robust, scalable, and secure architecture that can handle real-time AI analysis, multi-modal data processing, and zero-knowledge proofs while maintaining HIPAA compliance and high performance.

Key requirements:

- Real-time AI analysis of text, audio, and video
- Secure data handling with zero-knowledge proofs
- HIPAA compliance for all data storage and processing
- High performance and scalability
- Multi-tenant support
- Extensible plugin architecture

## Decision

We have decided to implement a microservices-based architecture with the following key components:

1. Frontend Layer:

   - Next.js for server-side rendering and static generation
   - React for component-based UI
   - TailwindCSS for styling
   - Vercel Edge Runtime for optimal performance

2. API Layer:

   - GraphQL API with federation
   - REST API for specific endpoints
   - WebSocket for real-time communication
   - Edge Functions for performance-critical operations

3. Core Services:

   - Authentication Service (Supabase)
   - AI Analysis Service (Custom)
   - Zero-Knowledge Proof Service (MP-SPDZ)
   - Storage Service (S3/Supabase)
   - Analytics Service (Custom)

4. Data Layer:

   - PostgreSQL for relational data
   - Redis for caching and real-time data
   - S3 for file storage
   - Vector database for AI embeddings

5. Infrastructure:
   - AWS for cloud infrastructure
   - Vercel for frontend deployment
   - Terraform for infrastructure as code
   - Docker for containerization
   - Kubernetes for orchestration

### Consequences

Positive:

- High scalability through microservices
- Improved development velocity with clear boundaries
- Better security through service isolation
- Flexible deployment options
- Easy integration of new services
- Clear separation of concerns

Negative:

- Increased operational complexity
- More points of failure
- Higher initial development effort
- More complex testing requirements
- Increased monitoring needs

### Alternatives Considered

1. Monolithic Architecture:

   - Rejected due to scalability limitations
   - Would have been simpler initially
   - Would limit future flexibility

2. Serverless-only Architecture:

   - Rejected due to cold start concerns
   - Would have higher costs at scale
   - Limited by platform constraints

3. Traditional Three-tier Architecture:
   - Rejected due to scalability concerns
   - Would not handle real-time requirements well
   - Limited flexibility for AI integration

## Implementation

1. Infrastructure Setup:

   - Deploy base AWS infrastructure with Terraform
   - Set up monitoring and logging
   - Configure security groups and networking

2. Core Services:

   - Implement authentication service
   - Build AI analysis pipeline
   - Create zero-knowledge proof system
   - Set up storage service

3. API Layer:

   - Implement GraphQL schema
   - Create REST endpoints
   - Set up WebSocket handlers
   - Configure Edge Functions

4. Frontend:

   - Build component library
   - Implement pages and routing
   - Add authentication flow
   - Create real-time features

5. Testing:
   - Unit tests for all services
   - Integration tests for API
   - E2E tests for critical flows
   - Performance testing
